# ðŸ’– Our Little Digital Love Note (and a few ASCII shenanigans) ðŸ’–

---

Welcome to our super-secret, slightly-glitchy, but *undeniably* heartfelt digital space. This isn't just any old project; it's a little corner of the internet dedicated to... well, *us*!

## âœ¨ What's Inside This Digital Gift Box? âœ¨

This is a simple, interactive ASCII art story. Think of it as a digital flip-book of our moments, powered by pure JavaScript magic (and a lot of my patience, this took my 5 straight days to do...)

*   **For Our Monthaversary:** This special edition is just for our monthaversary, with more to come!
*   **ASCII Art Background:** A custom-made, perfectly aligned (after much struggle!) ASCII background that sets the mood.
*   **Falling Petals:** Delicate ASCII petals drifting down, just like our love... or maybe just like actual petals. You decide!
*   **Special Messages:** Click anywhere to reveal our little love notes. (Go on, try it!)

## ðŸš€ How to Experience Our Digital Romance (or just debug my code) ðŸš€

No fancy installations needed! Just open `index.html` in your browser. 

**Pro-Tip for Maximum Romance:** Dim the lights, put on some cheesy love songs.

## A Peek Behind the Curtain (for the curious, or if something breaks)

This little gem is built with:
*   **HTML:** The bones of our digital love letter.
*   **CSS:** Making everything look pretty (and centered, eventually!).
*   **JavaScript:** The brains behind the animation and our scene transitions.
*   **`background.txt`:** Where all the ASCII art magic lives (and where I spent *a lot* of time).

This project is a testament to our journey â€“ sometimes a bit messy, always evolving, and ultimately, beautiful. Thanks for being you. You make every line of code (and every moment) extraordinary.
