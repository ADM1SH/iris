# Will You Be My Girlfriend — Interactive Visual Art

A cute, themed interactive generative art piece + playful “Will you be my girlfriend?” question overlay, inspired by **Chikawa**, **flowers**, and **blind boxes**.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a software-based visual art project combining:

- Generative visuals (particles, drifting petals, box shapes, etc.)
- Soft pastel / Chikawa / flower theme
- An overlay modal that asks: *“Will you be my girlfriend?”*  
  - The **No** button playfully avoids being clicked  
  - The **Yes** button triggers a celebration and heartfelt message

It’s designed to be fun, charming, and memorable.

## 🧩 Features

- Animated background: drifting petals, floating blind box icons, soft colours  
- Interactivity: visuals respond to mouse / cursor  
- Modal dialog with two buttons (**Yes / No**), styled with theme  
- “No” button moves away / jitters to prevent being clicked  
- “Yes” button triggers a celebratory sequence (petal burst, characters, message)  
- Responsive layout (works on desktop & mobile)  
- Easy to customize: colours, shapes, speed, images, fonts  

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools

| Component | Technology / Library | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Front-end visuals | p5.js (or HTML5 Canvas + JS) | For generative / animated visuals |
| UI / overlay | HTML + CSS + JavaScript | Modal, button styles, transitions |
| Hosting | Static hosting (GitHub Pages, Tiiny, etc.) | To share the link |
| Asset files | Images (Chikawa icons / flowers), fonts, CSS | For theming |
| Local dev | Simple HTTP server / live reload | To test locally |

You can adapt the visuals part either with p5.js (easier for creative coding) or vanilla Canvas + JS, whichever you prefer.
