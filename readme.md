# A Story in ASCII ‚Äî Hachiware's Proposal

A from-scratch, single-page interactive story told entirely through layered ASCII art. This project features a detailed, animated background, a foreground character animation, and a playful interactive narrative.

## üéØ Project Vision

This project aims to create a rich, heartfelt experience using only text characters. It leverages layered animations to create a sense of depth, with a slow-moving, atmospheric background behind a more dynamic foreground character. The narrative guides the user through a short, sweet story culminating in a question with a unique interactive twist.

## üß© Features

-   **Layered ASCII Animation:** A detailed background with drifting petals and growing vines animates independently from the foreground character, creating depth.
-   **Character Animation:** A multi-frame Hachiware character walks across the screen to present a lily-of-the-valley flower.
-   **Full Narrative Sequence:** The story progresses through timed scenes, from an introductory message to a final celebration.
-   **Evasive ASCII Button:** The `[ No ]` button is rendered in ASCII but is attached to an invisible HTML overlay. When hovered, it triggers JavaScript to redraw the button in a new location, making it playfully difficult to click.
-   **ASCII Modal & Celebration:** The proposal is presented in a stylized ASCII modal. A "Yes" click triggers a celebratory scene with falling hearts and a smiling character.
-   **Responsive Design:** The layout and font size adapt to different screen widths to ensure the art is always readable.

## üé® Customization

All creative content can be modified in `ascii.js`.

-   **Change Text & Messages**: Edit the `STORY_TEXT` object to change the narrative.
-   **Edit ASCII Art**: The `ASSETS` object contains all ASCII art for the background, character, and effects. You can edit these multi-line strings directly.
-   **Adjust Timings**: The `runStorySequence` function controls the delays between scenes. Modify the `wait()` values to change the story's pacing.
-   **Animation Behavior**: Constants at the top of the script like `BG_PETAL_COUNT` or `RENDER_INTERVAL` can be tweaked to change animation density and speed.
